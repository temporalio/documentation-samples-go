/*
The first parameter of an Activity Definition is `context.Context`.
This parameter is optional for an Activity Definition, though it is recommended, especially if the Activity is expected to use other Go SDK APIs.

An Activity Definition can support as many other custom parameters as needed.
However, all parameters must be serializable (parameters canâ€™t be channels, functions, variadic, or unsafe pointers), and it is recommended to pass a single struct that can be updated later.

	ActivityParamX string
	ActivityParamY int

/*
A Go-based Activity Definition can return either just an `error` or a `customValue, error` combination (same as a Workflow Definition).
You may wish to use a `struct` type to hold all custom values, just keep in mind they must all be serializable.
*/

// Additionally, your function signature remains compatible if the fields change.

In the Temporal Go SDK programming model, an Activity Definition is an exportable function or a `struct` method.
Below is an example of a basic exportable function.

// If the Worker crashes this Activity object loses its state.

	SharedMessageState *string
	SharedCounterState *int

// YourActivityDefinition is your custom Activity Definition.
// An Activity Definiton is an exportable function.
func (a *YourActivityObject) YourActivityDefinition(ctx context.Context, param YourActivityParam) (YourActivityResultObject, error) {
	// Use Acivities for computations or calling external APIs.

/*
An _Activity struct_ can have more than one method, with each method acting as a separate Activity Type.
Activities written as struct methods can use shared struct variables, such as:

- an application level DB pool
- client connection to another service
- reusable utilities
- any other expensive resources that you only want to initialize once per process

Because this is such a common need, the rest of this guide shows Activities written as `struct` methods.
*/

	logger := activity.GetLogger(ctx)
	logger.Info("The current message is:", *a.SharedMessageState)
	logger.Info("The current counter is:", *a.SharedCounterState)
